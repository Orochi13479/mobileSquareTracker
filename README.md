Robot following a straight line by observing a square using Turtlebot


This project aims to control the robot to follow a straight line by
using the information observed from a sensor on-board the robot.
Suppose there is a square in front of the robot, and there is a
sensor which can observe the positions of the 4 corners of the
square in the current robot coordinate frame. Control the robot to
follow a straight line which is perpendicular to the square. Use
Turtlebot or Simulator and design the environment to control the
robot with noise in the observation.
